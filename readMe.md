This is a documentation of my process for this project; I will do my best to keep this as updated as possible. 




11/6/21 [Brain Storming]:
I want this game to be like one of the cool math ones I used to play as a kid. I am looking at web games online to get inspiration. If I can't decide by tomorrow night I will be making a memory game for 2 players... am liking the idea of a 1 or 2 button game too. 
Initial concept: character is moving forward with objects that will come with potentially being able to kill character. Character will have another functioning button that is able to kill objects moving towards it?

11/8/21 [Starting Off]:
- Basic structural coding today. Won't try and do anything fancy except get it to work! Making note to get familiar with canvas HTML 
- Managed to get the object to move towards character infinitly  
- Got Character able to jump but only with mouse click. I want to use keyboard keys.
- used getComputedStyle & getPropertyValue for first time, still not completely sure how to impliment them because it is not working... for now

11/10/21 [Working]:
Aiming to get space bar functional and to use it to get character to jump.
